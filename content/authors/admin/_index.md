Hi! I am a PhD student in Finance at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu). I am interested in exploring research questions in Asset Pricing and Macro-Finance. Previously, I was a research fellow at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com), Bangalore where I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Mining and Marketing.

I graduated from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) in 2016. At IIT Kanpur, I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Program Analysis. In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming and playing football and squash. I also enjoy tabletop gaming, playing the guitar and listening to music.
